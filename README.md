# Anchor Generator
Anchor Generator programmatically creates HTML anchor tags from a list of PDFs as src's and a list of file names in order.

*Note: The src generated will automatically create a relative link with a standard WordPress uploads file path using the following structure: `/wp-content/uploads/${YEAR}/${MONTH}/$FILE`*
